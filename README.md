Movie Booking Interface ( Javascript/HTML Webpage )
-----

```bash
!! database is no longer being hosted externally !!
```

A Movie Booking interface where users can create and login into accounts using an email, username, and password. Info gets tokenized and saved onto a database which was hosted on a cloud server. There are "admin" users and "default" users. Admins are able to suspend, edit, and delete users. Admins can also add, edit, and delete Movies giving them a title, decription, image, cast, etc. Default users are able to book a specific movie at a specific time and reserve a specific seat. All this info gets saved in the database. I was the database engineer: I wrote all the SQL code and setup the database to be hosted on a cloud server. I also wrote all the HTML and Javascript for the pages that had any interaction with the database.
